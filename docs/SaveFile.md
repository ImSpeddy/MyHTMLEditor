When closing files, WebBox will prompt you to save the file if it has unsaved changes. You can choose to save the file or discard the changes.

Whenever a file has unsaved changes, the file name will be displayed in _italic_ in the tab bar. This is a visual indicator that the file has unsaved changes.
